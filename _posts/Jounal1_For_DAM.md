### Topic : Unit I: Introduction to Neural Networks and Deep Learning

Welcome! This will be the starting of my journey of noting what I am learning in the DAM101 module. Before starting the real lesson we learned about what is AI and the history of AI like how it was found by Arthur Samuel in 1957 when developed a program to play checkers against.Then we learned the difference between Machine learning and Deep learning. After that we learned that ML are trained by feeding the data that are recorded. 

We looked into neural networks that showed that there are 3 types of layer like input layer, hidden layer and the output layer. Inorder for the model to be trained data must be fed and thats what happens in the input layer. When feeding data theres two types and they are supervised and unsupervised data, which differs from each other incase of its data type (structured and labeled data) and the time and computation space they take. In the hidden layer the training of the model takes place but we learned that we won't know how its train and why  we get the output near to actual value.

We learned about the loss function, backward flow or propagation, forward flow/propagation,learning rate which can be affected by weight initialization and bias, epoch which represents a single pass through the entire training dataset during the training of a neural network. so what  epoch does is each of it involves both forward and backward propagation, where the network makes predictions (forward propagation) and then adjusts its weights and biases based on the errors it made (backward propagation).

To conclude, we learned the basics of how AI is trained and how it came to the world. When looking into it we also learned what is involved in training an AI and about the neural network of how AI learns the data.
