# Topic : Types of Nonrelational Databases
----
## What is Relational Databases
A relational database stores information in tables with specific pieces and types of data. Relational databases use Structured Query Language (SQL) to manage and query the data. 

## What is Nonrelational Databases
A non-relational database, often referred to as NoSQL, stores data in a non-tabular form. They use different data structures like documents, graphs, or key-value pairs

## Types of Nonrelational Database
### Document Based Database

A Document Database in NoSQL stores and retrieves data in documents, diverging from traditional relational databases organized by rows and columns. These documents, often formatted in JSON, BSON, or XML, encapsulate data as key-value pairs, enabling a flexible and hierarchical data structure.

### Advantages

1. **No strict rules:** we can store data without needing to decide on a fixed structure beforehand.

2. **Quick to make and maintain:** Creating and updating documents is easy and doesn't take much effort.

3. **Easy to share:** Data is stored in simple formats like JSON, making it easy to work with and share.

4. **Keeps track of changes:** It can remember how documents change over time, which helps manage complex data.

### Disadvantages

1. **Not great for big transactions:** It struggles with handling big operations that involve multiple documents at once.

2. **Checking consistency can be slow:** Sometimes, making sure all documents are correct can slow down the database.

3. **Security worries:** Because it's often used for web apps, there can be concerns about keeping data safe from hackers.

### Applications

1. **Managing content:** Perfect for websites with lots of different types of content, like blogs or video sites.

2. **Organizing books:** Useful for libraries or bookstores to keep track of book info in a structured way.

3. **Handling big catalogs:** Good for stores with lots of products, as it can handle lots of information easily.

4. **Doing analytics:** Great for analyzing data and finding trends, like in sales or website traffic.

### Key-Value based databases

A key-value data model, also known as a key-value store, is a type of non-relational database where data is stored as simple key-value pairs.

2. **Quick to make and maintain:** Creating and updating key-value pairs is easy and doesn't take much effort.

3. **Easy to share:** Data is stored in simple formats like JSON, making it easy to work with and share.

4. **Keeps track of changes:** It can remember how key-value pairs change over time, which helps manage complex data.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Not great for big transactions:** It struggles with handling big operations that involve multiple key-value pairs at once.

2. **Checking consistency can be slow:** Sometimes, making sure all key-value pairs are correct can slow down the database.

3. **Security worries:** Because it's often used for web apps, there can be concerns about keeping data safe from hackers.

### Application:

1. User session attributes in real-time applications like finance or gaming, where quick access to random data is crucial.

2. Caching mechanism for frequently accessed data or key-based designs, optimizing performance by storing data closer to the application.

3. Ideal for applications relying heavily on key-based queries, simplifying data retrieval and manipulation based on unique identifiers.

### Graph Database
A graph database is a type of NoSQL database that is designed to handle data with complex relationships and interconnections. In a graph database, data is stored as nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities and edges represent the relationships between those entities.

### Advantages

1. **Efficient data modeling:** Allows flexible and scalable data modeling.

2. **Flexible relationships:** Handles complex relationships well.

3. **High performance:** Optimized for large and complex datasets.

4. **Scalability:** Easily scales to handle increased data volume or traffic.

5. **Easy to use:** Typically simpler to use and maintain than traditional relational databases.

### Disadvantages:

1. **Slower for complex relationships:** Sometimes slower for very complex relationship queries.

2. **Platform-dependent query language:** The query language may vary between platforms.

3. **Not suitable for transactional data:** May not be the best choice for transactional data.

4. **Limited use cases:** Not suitable for all applications, especially those requiring simple queries.

### Applications:

1. **Recommendation engines:** Provides accurate recommendations in e-commerce.

2. **Social media:** Finds connections between friends and products.

3. **Fraud detection:** Identifies fraudulent transactions by analyzing relationships.

4. **Network and infrastructure management:** Manages complex network relationships effectively.

###  Vector Databases

A Vector Database is a type of relational database system specifically tailored to handle vectorized data. Instead of conventional tables, rows, and columns, it processes vectorsâ€”arrays of numerical values representing points in multidimensional space.

Embedding is a data like words that have been converted into an array of numbers known as a vector that contains patterns of relationships the combination of these numbers that make up the vector act as a multi-dimensional map to measure similarity.

### Timeseries Database

A Time Series Database (TSDB) is a software system that is optimized to handle time series data, arrays of numbers indexed by time (a datetime or a datetime range). Time series data is a sequence of data points indexed in time order making them ideal for applications that require the analysis of historical data over time. Examples of time series data include stock prices, weather data, and sensor readings.

### Disadvantages
1. **Complexity:** TSDBs can be more complex to set up and manage compared to traditional relational databases.

2. **Limited Query Flexibility:** While they are optimized for time series data, TSDBs may offer limited flexibility in querying compared to more general-purpose databases.
3. **Learning Curve:** There can be a steep learning curve for developers who are not familiar with time series data and the specific features and syntax of TSDBs.

4. **Cost:** Some TSDBs can be expensive, especially for large-scale deployments.

5. **Limited Support for Non-Time Series Data:** While they excel at handling time series data, TSDBs may not be the best choice for applications that require handling a wide variety of data types.

### Applications
