# Topic : How to Build a Relational Database From Scratch
----

### What's a database

A database is an organized collection of structured data stored and accessed electronically. It is made so that large amounts of data can be quickly retrieved, added, or deleted.

### Building a Relational Database From Scratch
Building a relational database from scratch requires careful planning and consideration of various factors. Important procedures to be followed and the significance of each step in the process:

**Purpose and Requirements Analysis:**
- Determining the purpose of the database and the specific requirements.
- Identify the types of data to be stored and the relationships between them.
- Define who will use the database and the types of queries to be performed.

**Importance:** This step lays the foundation for the entire database development process by clarifying the objectives and scope of the project. It ensures that the database design aligns with the needs of its users.

**Choose a Database Management System (DBMS):**
- Evaluate different DBMS options based on the project requirements.
- Consider factors such as scalability, performance, and cost.
- Select a DBMS that best fits the needs of the project.

**Importance:** The choice of DBMS significantly impacts the functionality and performance of the database. Selecting the appropriate DBMS ensures optimal storage, retrieval, and management of data.

**Design the Database Schema:**
- Create a visual representation of the database structure using entity-relationship diagrams or similar tools.
- Define tables, columns, data types, and relationships between tables.
- Specify constraints such as primary keys and foreign keys.

**Importance:** Database schema design is crucial for organizing and structuring data in a logical manner. It ensures data integrity, facilitates efficient data retrieval, and minimizes redundancy.

**Implement the Database Schema:**
- Create tables and columns in the chosen DBMS according to the designed schema.
- Define primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.
- Set up indexes for optimizing query performance.

I**mportance:** Implementing the database schema translates the design into a functional database structure. Proper implementation ensures that the database operates efficiently and maintains data consistency.

**Populate the Database with Data:**
- Insert initial data into the tables based on the requirements.
- Validate the data to ensure it meets the defined constraints.
- Consider importing existing data from external sources if applicable.

**Importance:** Populati.ng the database with data allows for testing and validation of the database structure. It ensures that the database is ready for use and contains relevant information for its intended purpose.

**Test the Database:**

- Perform various queries and transactions to validate the functionality of the database.
- Verify data accuracy, consistency, and integrity.
Identify and address any errors or performance issues.

**Importance:** Testing is essential for ensuring the reliability and effectiveness of the database. It helps identify and resolve any issues before deployment, minimizing the risk of errors in production.

**Maintain the Database:**

- Regularly backup the database to prevent data loss.
- Monitor database performance and optimize as needed.
0ake updates and modifications to accommodate evolving requirements.

**Importance:** Database maintenance is crucial for ensuring ongoing performance, security, and scalability. Regular maintenance activities help prevent data loss, improve efficiency, and adapt to changing needs.


### Popular DBMS for Database Development

| Types of DBMS | Definition |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| MySQL | A widely used open-source relational database management system. |
| PostgreSQL | A powerful and open-source object-relational database management system. |
| Microsoft SQL Server| A popular commercial relational database management system. |
| Oracle Database | A powerful and widely used commercial relational database management system. |
| Microsoft Access| A database management system (DBMS) that combines the relational Microsoft Jet Database Engine with a graphical user interface and software-development tools. |
| MongoDB | A document-oriented NoSQL database management system known for its scalability and ease of use. |


### Factoring affecting when choosing DBMS
- **Purpose:** Different DBMS optimized for various purposes like transaction processing or data warehousing.
- **Scale:** Consider database size, user count, and data volume for scalability needs.
- **Performance:** Evaluate response time and throughput requirements for queries and transactions.
- **Cost:** Assess licensing fees and hardware requirements for budget considerations.
