### Topic :  Entity Relationship Diagram for a real world system.
----
Welcome! Today's content will be about the implementation of ERD in a real wrold system.ERDs are powerful tools for visualizing the logical structure of a database, which in turn makes it easier to design and understand complex data models.

Before understanding its applications, let's explore what's needed to create an ERD. Firstly,there are Entities or Entity, denoted by rectangles, which are connected to ellipses representing Attributes describing the properties of the entity. Moreover, we  learned about different types of attributes such as Simple, Composite, Single-valued, Multivalued, and Derived attributes.

After understanding entities and attributes, we looked into their relationships through Mapping Cardinalities like One-to-One, One-to-Many, Many-to-One, and Many-to-Many.To represent each Cardinalities Crowâ€™s Foot Notation was learned. Moreover, we learned how each entities Participate in a Relationship of entities and how Redundant Attributes can be removed in a Entity Sets.

ER diagrams are a powerful tool for visualizing the logical structure of a database, making it easier to design and understand complex data models. By useing the right symbols and methods, developers can make ER diagrams that act as a clear plan and serve as a blueprint for database implementation.

#### What we learned in Flipped class
Today, our aim was to understand how ERD models are used in real-world systems.We were divided into 6 groups, and as Group 3, we drew an ERD for a Mobile Banking Application handling Credit and Debit Accounts.

Through discussions, we came to know a lot like which all can be marked as entities and attribute.For instance, attribute like Users,Account and Transaction had at the max of 6 entities from which one of them was a primary entity.We also learned how to draw the notation that represents the Cardinalities and the relationship they each represents. Moreover, we got more knowledge as each group made presentation on their groups ERD modle and through Miss's constructive feedback.

In conclusion, the class was successful as we gained knowledge about the involvement of ERD models in the real world system and the process of drawing them for database systems.

##### Feedback
it would be beneficial if Miss could continue the practice of providing feedback immediately after each presentation we deliver.
