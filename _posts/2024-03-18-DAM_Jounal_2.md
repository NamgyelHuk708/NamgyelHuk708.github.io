**What is Data and its two type**
Data is a word we hear everywhere nowadays. In general, data is a collection of facts, information, and statistics and this can be in various forms such as numbers, text, sound, images, video or any other format. And it has two type namily Structured data and Unstructured data.

1. Structured Data
- Organized in a clear, predefined format like tables.
- Easy to analyze and process.
- Examples: databases, spreadsheets.

2. Unstructured Data
- Lacks a predefined format or structure.
- Contains diverse, complex information like text, images,videos.
- Challenging to analyze and process directly.

It knows that AI are trained by feeding a combination of both structured and unstructured data allowing them to leverage the strengths of each type and produce more comprehensive results.

**Data Preprocessing**
Like all even machine learning can learn and train faster if they are fed with structure and well formated datasets. 
Now what data preprocessing means is that its transforming of the data into a format that is easier and effective to be fed to AI which makees it easier for them to learn and to get accurte output.

**Types of Preprocessing**\
1. **Text preprocessing**
